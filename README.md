# unity-flying-blocks
Very basic unity game covering some fundamentals.

Very well documented code so that I can go back and relearn important aspects of early unity game development easily.
This game is a proof of concept, proving that I can make a unity game with different levels, menu screens, winning, losing & restarting, and gameplay that feels both active and smooth.
I plan to use these concepts in future projects, and check back on this project when I need refreshers on any of the code.
